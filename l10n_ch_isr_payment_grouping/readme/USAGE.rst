Once installed this module will automatically ungroup the ISR payments.

Wether you check or not the `Group Invoices` checkbox ISR payments are split
by ISR reference.

The ISR reference is read from the `Vendor Reference` field on Vendor Bill.

To consider Vendor Bill as using ISR, it must have:

- an ISR reference
- a bank account with a valid ISR issuer
  postal account starting with 01 or 03
