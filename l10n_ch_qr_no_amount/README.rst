| This module adds a new report that allows to print QR bills without
  any amount,
| so that the customer can define himself the amount to pay.

Not setting the amount allows to use the same QR code for multiple
payments referencing the same invoice.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
